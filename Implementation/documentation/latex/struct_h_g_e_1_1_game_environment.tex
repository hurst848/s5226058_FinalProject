\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Is a strucure that stores environmental data. 

The Environment Structure stores data that needs to kept seperate from core. This data includes the \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_h_g_e_1_1_camera}{Camera}} as well as the calculation of delta\+Time. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
Environment.\+h\item 
Environment.\+cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
